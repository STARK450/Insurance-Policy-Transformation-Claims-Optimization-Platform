Insurance Policy Transformation and Claims Optimization Platform

This project represents a Business Technology Transformation initiative carried out for a General Insurance organization undergoing modernization of its core policy and claims operations. The objective of the project was to improve operational efficiency, reduce turnaround time, and align legacy insurance processes with modern digital business needs.

The organization was facing challenges such as manual policy issuance, delayed claims settlement, limited visibility across departments, and misalignment between business users and technical teams. To address these issues, a structured transformation programme was initiated covering both policy management and claims processing systems.

In this project, I worked in the role of a Business Analyst, collaborating closely with insurance stakeholders including underwriting teams, claims managers, operations users, and IT delivery teams. I was responsible for gathering, analyzing, prioritizing, and validating business requirements through detailed discussions and facilitated user workshops. A strong focus was maintained on understanding both business expectations and technical constraints to effectively bridge the gap between stakeholders and development teams.

The project followed a hybrid delivery approach. Certain modules were executed using a traditional Waterfall model where detailed upfront documentation was required, while customer-facing and high-change areas such as claims processing were delivered using Agile Scrum methodology. I actively participated in Agile ceremonies including sprint planning, backlog refinement, sprint reviews, and user acceptance testing support.

Strong domain knowledge in General Insurance was applied throughout the project, covering the complete policy lifecycle from quotation to renewal and the end-to-end claims lifecycle from first notification of loss to final settlement. Business process flows were analyzed and redesigned to create improved future-state processes aligned with transformation goals.

Key deliverables included business requirement documentation, functional specifications, user stories with acceptance criteria, as-is and to-be process flows, and UAT scenarios. The project successfully improved collaboration between business and IT teams, enhanced process transparency, and supported the organization’s broader digital transformation objectives.
